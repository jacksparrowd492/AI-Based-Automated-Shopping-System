### AI-Based Automated Shopping System

**Problem Statement:**
Traditional shopping systems often involve manual barcode scanning and checkout processes, leading to long queues and delays. This not only frustrates customers but also increases labor costs for retailers. Additionally, billing errors due to misidentification or misplaced items further complicate the process. The need for a more efficient and automated solution is paramount to improve the shopping experience for both customers and retailers.

**Objective:**
The project aims to develop an AI-based automated shopping system that utilizes deep learning to enable seamless product detection and real-time billing. The system integrates several technologies:
- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automatic recognition of products added to or removed from a shopping basket.
- A load cell sensor for weight validation to ensure accuracy during the checkout process.
- A QR-based authentication system to facilitate smooth checkout and payment.

By automating the checkout process, this solution enhances the overall shopping experience, reduces labor costs, and minimizes billing errors.

**Approach:**
- **Dataset:** The system is trained on datasets like Open Food Facts, ImageNet, and a custom dataset containing grocery item images captured in various lighting conditions and angles.
- **Data Analysis:** The images undergo preprocessing steps including image enhancement (e.g., adjusting contrast and brightness), data augmentation (such as flipping, rotation, and scaling), normalization, and resizing to improve the CNN modelâ€™s accuracy.
- **Product Detection and Tracking:** A CNN-based model, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) or EfficientNet, is trained to recognize grocery items and track them in real time with unique identifiers.
- **Weight-Based Verification:** A load cell sensor is used to measure the weight of the basket, ensuring that products are accurately added or removed during the checkout process.
- **Real-Time Billing:** As items are added or removed, the system updates the bill instantly, and generates a QR code for easy checkout.
- **Exit Verification:** At the exit, a camera verifies the basket's contents against the bill and checks the payment status using the QR-based system.

**Key Results:**
- The CNN model achieved high accuracy in product recognition.
- Real-time billing significantly reduced checkout times.
- The load cell sensor provided weight validation, ensuring accurate billing and preventing errors.
- The integration of QR code-based authentication streamlined the checkout process.

**Modeling and Techniques Used:**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** Utilized for product recognition in the shopping system.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once):** Implemented for real-time object detection, allowing fast and efficient identification of items in the basket.
- **Load Cell Integration:** Used for weight verification to validate product addition and removal, preventing misbilling.
- **OpenCV:** Applied for real-time tracking and exit validation, ensuring the system accurately identifies the products in the basket at the time of exit.
- **TensorFlow Lite:** Optimized the CNN model for mobile and embedded system deployment, ensuring the system can run efficiently on various devices.

**Conclusion:**
This AI-based automated shopping system replaces traditional checkout methods, enhancing both operational efficiency and customer experience. By automating product recognition, billing, and validation, it streamlines the shopping process, reduces labor costs, and minimizes errors. Future improvements could include expanding the product database, integrating fraud detection mechanisms, and improving real-time tracking to handle more complex product variations. This system is designed to be integrated into retail environments, offering a more efficient, convenient, and user-friendly shopping experience.
